A major problem for emergency responders is to assess the severity of the distress. If more ambulance staff is dispatched, emergency responders might not have enough resources to effectively respond to a second distress call and if too few staff are dispatched, the number of casualities or injuries might increase. It is the same for police offciers and fire fighters. Deployment of too many or too few policemen and fire fighters is problematic hence it is of profound significance that emergency responders have an accurate estimate of the severity of traffic accidents they are rushing to attend to. What makes this an even more important challenge is the rising frequency of such incidents. The quantity of fatal crashes went from 508 in 2016 to 525 in 2017, resulting in the death of 555 people so the resources at disposal are even more stressed. 

This study aims to identify patterns and uncover insights that will help the responders deploy more efficiently and accurately. Some statistics have long been in the circulation e.g the highest number of crashes occur on Saturdays or in the month of November. Researchers in this study are going have attemped to uncover even greater depths e.g what are the odds of a high severity accident on a saturday if its around a holiday? Does it tend to be higher because people want to have fun outside or is it lower because people want to spend time with family at home? Such insights are crucial to deployment of the right number of staff/equipment so that maximum lives and limbs can be saved.
