The data for this study has been sourced from Seattle Traffic Department. It is high quality data because it has recorded many accidents under varying condions e.g the accidents on a specific block under snowy, rainy and sunny weather conditions. This degree of detail help identify relationships between important factors that collaborate to affect an accident's severity. 

Some very useful fields from the data are briefly described below:
- SEVERITYCODE: is the severity of the accident known? How severve was it? Did passengers incur only minor injuries or did it prove to be fatal?
- COLLISIONTYPE: the motion of the vehicles involved
- PERSONCOUNT: total number of people involved in the collision
- PEDCOUNT: The number of pedestrians involved in the collision
- INJURIES: The number of total injuries in the collision
- SERIOUSINJURIES: The number of serious injuries in the collision
- FATALITIES: The number of fatalities in the collision
- JUNCTIONTYPE: Category of junction at which collision took place
- WEATHER: The description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision
- ROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision
- SPEEDING: Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision
- INCDATE: The date of the incident
- INCDTTM: The date and time of the incident.

Futher features can be developed from the data set which may or may not be factors e.g INCTTM (time of incident) field can be used to create a new feature 'During Night Hours' and maybe, the data will predict accidents tend to be more severe during night hours.
